# Corsair-Void-USB-C-Mod

Hello together,
my headset had the, apparently typical problem of the Corsair Void Wireless, where the Micro Usb connector has a loose contact. 
After I had seen a photo on reddit with a USB-C conversion, but without photos or a tutorial written about it, I had thought to just do it myself.

So if you have the problem with a broken micro USB port or just want to have a USB-C port on your Corsair Void wireless, I hope this tutorial helps you.
